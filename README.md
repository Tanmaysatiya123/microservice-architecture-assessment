# Microservice Application (User Service & Order Service)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This application comprises **two Spring Boot microservice modules**:

- **User Service:** Manages User CRUD operations.
- **Order Service:** Handles Order CRUD operations and validates User IDs against User Service.

The services use **H2 in-memory databases** for simplicity and demonstration.

- **OrderNotFoundException**

Controllers respond with appropriate **HTTP statuses and messages**.
