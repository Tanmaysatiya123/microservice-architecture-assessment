# Microservice Application (User Service & Order Service)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This application comprises **two Spring Boot microservice modules**:

- **User Service:** Manages User CRUD operations.
- **Order Service:** Handles Order CRUD operations and validates User IDs against User Service.

The services use **H2 in-memory databases** for simplicity and demonstration.

## ðŸ”¹ Architectural Components

microservice/
â”œâ”€ user-service/
| â”œâ”€ UserController, UserService, UserRepository
| â”œâ”€ UserNotFoundException, GlobalExceptionHandler
â””â”€ order-service/
â”œâ”€ OrderController, OrderService, OrderRepository
â”œâ”€ UserClient (to validate User IDs against User service)
â”œâ”€ UserValidationException, GlobalExceptionHandler

## ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling
Custom Exception handlers have been implemented in each service:
- **UserNotFoundException**
- **UserValidationException**
- **OrderNotFoundException**

Controllers respond with appropriate **HTTP statuses and messages**.

âœ… Tip:
Make sure UserService is up first (since OrderService depends on it).
Then start OrderService.
